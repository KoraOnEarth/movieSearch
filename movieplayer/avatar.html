						<h2>AVATAR (2009)</h2>

					<div class="description">
						<p>
							In 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted.
							The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable
							mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star
							system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is
							inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned,
							sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore
							Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human
							hybrids called "avatars". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to
							Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up
							to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine
							considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.
						</p>
						<p>
							While escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's
							avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and he flees into the
							forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of
							Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the
							spiritual leader of the clan, orders her daughter to initiate Jake
							into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security
							force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his
							legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their
							gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit
							of unobtanium.

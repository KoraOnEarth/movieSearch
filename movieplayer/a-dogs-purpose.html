						<h2>A DOG`S PURPOSE (2017)</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							In the 1950s, a feral puppy wonders about life's true purpose.
							Weeks later, he is caught by dog catchers, whisked away to the
							pound, and euthanized. The dog is reborn as a Red Retriever in
							1961. Leaving his cage at a puppy mill, he is taken by two garbage
							men who plan to sell him. Left locked inside their pick-up truck,
							he begins to die of heatstroke, but is rescued by a kindhearted
							mother and her eight-year-old son Ethan Montgomery. They break the
							truck's window and bring him home, naming him Bailey. Bailey and
							Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer at Ethan's
							grandparents' farm, and Bailey decides Ethan alone is his purpose.
							Ethan gives him the nickname “Boss Dog”. Years pass, and after
							several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has
							become an alcoholic.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1969, Ethan meets a girl named Hannah at a fair with Bailey,
							and they soon begin dating. They spend their summer together,
							happily though senior year. They plan to go to the same college,
							Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah with an academic
							one. At home one night, Ethan's drunken father becomes abusive
							towards his mother and him. Ethan orders him to leave and never
							return. Later in 1971 at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan
							is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State. That night, his
							vindictive classmate Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's
							house, causing a house fire.

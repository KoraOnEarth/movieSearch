						<h2>THE GENTLEMEN (2019)</h2>

					<div class="description">
						<p>
							Born into poverty in the United States, Pearson won a Rhodes
							Scholarship to Oxford University, where he began selling marijuana
							to fellow students before dropping out and building his criminal
							empire by violence. He now plans to sell his business to American
							billionaire Matthew Berger for Â£400m so he can retire peacefully
							with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs
							where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic
							landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes.
							Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese
							gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's
							business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur
							MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers "The Toddlers" who overpower
							the lab's guards, steal a vanload of marijuana and upload a rap
							video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as
							Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he
							discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.

						<h2>THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (2006)</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							In 1981, San Francisco salesman Chris Gardner invests his entire
							life savings in portable bone-density scanners, which he
							demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy improvement over
							standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in Chris's life.
							While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the
							sales and his growing financial demands enrage his wife, Linda,
							who works as a hotel maid. The economic instability increasingly
							erodes their marriage, despite caring for Christopher Jr., their
							soon-to-be five-year-old son.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Chris is trying to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay
							Twistle, a lead manager and partner for Dean Witter Reynolds, and
							impresses him by solving a Rubik's Cube during a taxi ride. After
							Jay leaves, Chris lacks the money to pay the fare and chooses to
							run instead, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a BART
							station. Chris boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the
							process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to
							become an intern stockbroker.

						<h2>THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013)</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="description">
						<p>
							In 1987, Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker
							for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly
							enticed into the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna's
							belief that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself.
							Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day
							stock market drop in history and takes a job at a boiler room
							brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks.
							Jordan makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching
							style and the high commissions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two found
							their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom
							Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell." Jordan's tactics and
							salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and
							dump scheme, which involves inflating the price of a stock by
							issuing misleading, positive statements in order to sell it at an
							artificially augmented price. When the scheme's perpetrators sell
							their overvalued securities, the price drops immensely, and those
							who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with
							stock that is suddenly worth much less than what they paid. To
							cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name
							Stratton Oakmont in 1989.
